Goals:

The goal for this project is to write a program that arranges the number from the smallest to the
largest given an array that we have to sort using bubble sort and pointers.

Input:

based on this assigemt there will be no input from the user 

Output:

the output of this program should basically print the unsorted array and print the swap procces
and then at the end it's going to print the after result which will be the sorted array.

steps:

first of all we need to define the functions that were given by the instructor in order for the program
to work, we need to define print values by making a for loop to over the array and print it, second we 
need to define sort which we will make a loop inside a loop to go over the arrays and to print all the
arrays while sorting, third we need to define swap which we need to includ pointer in order for the 
program to work.
